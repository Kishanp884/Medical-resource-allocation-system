The Medical Resource Allocation System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage hospital resources such as beds, staff, IV drips, and organ transportation. The system improves patient care by automating resource allocation, monitoring critical parameters, and generating alerts for medical staff.

This project focuses on improving hospital efficiency, reducing manual workload, and ensuring patient safety through digital monitoring and management.

 Problem Statement

Hospitals face challenges such as:

Manual tracking of medical resources

Delay in identifying critical situations

Inefficient allocation of beds and staff

Lack of real-time IV and organ monitoring

These issues can lead to treatment delays, resource wastage, and increased risk to patients.
This system solves these problems by providing an automated, centralized, and reliable solution.

 Target Users (Personas)

Doctors – Allocate resources and monitor patients

Nurses – Monitor IV drips and patient condition

Hospital Admins – Manage staff and hospital resources

Lab Technicians – Track organ safety
